  1. Type 'dmesg' or 'dmesg | grep USB'
     You should see this line at the end:
     'usb 2-2.1: cp21x converter now attached to tty'

  2. Install Minicom:
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install minicom
     Open Minicom and configure it (only the first time) using the following command:
       sudo minicom -sw
     Go to “Serial port setup” and edit as follow:
       Serial Device: /dev/ttyUSB0
       Hardware Flow Control: No
       Software Flow Control: No
     Press exit and “Save setup as dfl”
     Exit from Minicom
     Let’s give proper access permissions to serial port with:
       sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

  3. Now we can start listening with:
       sudo minicom -w
